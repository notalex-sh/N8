**In progress**

this will be a tool for malware analysis, by essentially logging all actions taken on the file system and over the network and other stuff

sort of like virus total sandboxing but open source and local

`dontnet run --target="/path/to/target.exe"`

TODO:
- Writes to log file
- Capture more events (registry + more)
- Better analysis
- Policy files
- API integration (abuseipd, virustotal? (would need hasing function, expensive!))
- Get better at C# and stop writing dookie code
